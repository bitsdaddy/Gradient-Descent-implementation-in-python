# Gradient-Descent-implementation-in-python

## Overview

Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning and numerical optimization. It is employed to minimize a cost function iteratively by adjusting the parameters of a model. The primary objective is to find the values of these parameters that result in the minimum cost.

## How Gradient Descent Works

1. **Objective Function:**
   - The optimization process begins with defining an objective function, often referred to as a cost function. In machine learning, this function quantifies the error or cost associated with the model's predictions.

2. **Gradient Calculation:**
   - The gradient of the objective function is computed with respect to the model parameters. The gradient points in the direction of the steepest ascent, and the negative gradient points in the direction of the steepest descent.

3. **Parameter Update:**
   - The parameters are updated iteratively by moving in the opposite direction of the gradient. The learning rate determines the step size for each update.

4. **Convergence:**
   - The process continues until a convergence criterion is met, such as a small change in parameters or reaching a predefined number of iterations.

## Implementation in Python

In this project, a basic implementation of gradient descent has been developed using Python. The implementation includes the following components:

- **Objective Function:**
  - The specific objective function being minimized is \(3w₀² + 4w₁² - 5w₀ + 7\).

- **Gradient Function:**
  - The gradient of the objective function is computed to guide the parameter updates.

- **Convergence Check:**
  - A convergence check ensures that the optimization stops when parameters are sufficiently close to the optimal values.

- **Gradient Descent Function:**
  - The main optimization routine iteratively updates parameters and checks for convergence or divergence.

## Usage

To use the gradient descent implementation, simply provide an initial set of parameters, a learning rate, and a convergence threshold. The algorithm will iteratively update the parameters until convergence is achieved.

```python
import numpy as np

# Example usage with adaptive learning rate
initial_parameters = [5, 10]
learning_rate = 0.1
convergence_threshold = 1e-6

descent(initial_parameters, initial_parameters, learning_rate, convergence_threshold)

```


# Adaptive Learning Rate in Gradient Descent

In the context of optimization algorithms like gradient descent, the learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter that determines the step size taken during each iteration. An adaptive learning rate adjusts itself during the optimization process based on the behavior of the objective function. This adaptation is designed to improve convergence and stability, especially in scenarios where a fixed learning rate may be suboptimal.

## Adaptive Learning Rate Implementation

In the provided Python code, an adaptive learning rate mechanism has been introduced to enhance the efficiency of the gradient descent optimization. The key idea behind this adaptation is to assess the change in the direction of the gradient vectors between consecutive iterations.

The `adaptive_learning_rate` function calculates the dot product of the new and previous gradient vectors and compares it with a threshold. If the angle between these vectors is less than 45 degrees, indicating a relatively aligned direction, the learning rate is increased. Conversely, if the angle is greater than 45 degrees, suggesting a change in direction, the learning rate is decreased.

This adaptive learning rate adjustment is integrated into the `descent` function, ensuring that the learning rate dynamically responds to the characteristics of the optimization landscape. The printed information during each iteration now includes the learning rate, providing insights into how the algorithm adapts to the evolving conditions of the objective function.

## How to Use

To leverage this adaptive learning rate functionality in our own optimization tasks, we simply need incorporate the provided `adaptive_learning_rate` function within our gradient descent implementation. We can adjust the initial learning rate based on the specific characteristics of our optimization problem.

We can experiment with different threshold values and adapt the mechanism to suit the requirements of our particular use case. The adaptive learning rate can be a valuable tool for improving the convergence behavior of your optimization algorithms. However, we have implemented the most basic and naive approach to the problem
and there is a vast scope of improvement.



# Problem when \( w[1] \) becomes zero and gradient also becomes zero

If \( w[1] \) becomes zero, and the gradient with respect to \( w[1] \) becomes zero as well, it can introduce challenges in the optimization process. In particular, it can lead to a situation where the algorithm struggles to make further progress in the \( w[1] \) direction, potentially causing slow convergence or convergence to a suboptimal solution.

When the gradient becomes zero, the update rule in the gradient descent algorithm would no longer have an effect on \( w[1] \), potentially causing the algorithm to stall. This situation is often referred to as a "flat" or "horizontal" region in the optimization landscape.

### Possible Approaches to Address the Issue

1. **Regularization:** Introduce regularization terms in the objective function, such as L1 or L2 regularization. This can help prevent \( w[1] \) from becoming exactly zero and add stability to the optimization process.

2. **Check for Singularities:** Monitor the optimization process and check for situations where \( w[1] \) is close to zero and the gradient is also close to zero. If this situation is detected, we might need to take special actions, such as adjusting the learning rate or introducing additional regularization.

3. **Use a Small Constant:** When updating \( w[1] \), instead of directly subtracting \( \text{{learning\_rate}} \times \text{{grad}}[1] \), add a small constant term to the update to ensure that even if the gradient is zero, there is still a small update. For example:
   ```python
   w_1 = w_prev[1] - lr * grad(w_prev)[1] + epsilon
   ```
where ϵ is a small constant.

4. **Consider Alternate Optimization Techniques:** In some cases, using alternate optimization techniques or different optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent, Adam, or others, may be more suitable for handling complex optimization landscapes.

We need to carefully monitor and analyze the behavior of our optimization algorithm, especially when encountering situations where \( w[1] \) and its gradient become zero. Adjusting hyperparameters and introducing regularization can often help address these challenges.
